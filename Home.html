<b><i>As with any location, you'd want to consider the weather and peak conditions before you go. Since the province covers a large area in Central Luzon, the weather in Zambales varies on which town you visit.
Generally, it follows
     <p>the same seasonal patterns as the rest of the Philippines, with wet months and dry months. Make sure you check weather forecasts to avoid any potential storms or heavy rainfall that could fall on your planned trip dates.
<p>November to May is typically the dry season, where it's enjoyable to go island hopping in the Philippines and do all sorts of water sports and activities. December might be densely crowded due to the holidays. The breeze is a bit
    <p>cooler around January to February, which also means the sun doesn't feel as harsh during this time. April and May are peak summer seasons, which also spell out large crowds. If you're not a fan of having a lot of people at the
        <p>beach on your trip, consider booking an exclusive resort or go on a different month. May to October is the wet season. Although, it doesn't rain every day, so it's still worth checking out forecasts for a more accurate picture of
            <p>weather conditions around this time. If you want to go surfing, however, you should visit during these months. The waves are much better at San Narciso, Zambales, which is good news for beginner to pro level surfers anywhere.
<p>Crowds are thinner too, and hotels sometimes lower their rates during the so-called "off-peak" season.

If you have the flexibility to spare, check the weather a week before your intended stay during off-peak season to score 
    <p>lower fees on hotels.</i></b></p></center>

       <h3><u>From Manila</u></h3>
        <p><i>If you're coming from Manila or the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), take the options below:</i></p>
       <br />
       <h3><u>By Private Car</u></h3>
       <p><i>One of the most convenient ways to reach the Zambales proper is via a private car or hire a van. You can use the Waze app to guide you through the best roads to pass by for the least amount of time possible.
It usually takes
           <p>around three hours to get here from Manila. Expect an extended drive if the traffic is heavy, or if you're going to a further part of the province.

You can also stop by to ask the locals for directions, or get yourself a Zambales map
               <p>to get a better overview of your trip.</i></p>
       <h3><u>By Bus</u></h3>
       <p><i>Catch Victory Liner buses from Manila and research the closest terminals near you. The two most popular ones are Cubao, Quezon City (northern part of Metro Manila) or Pasay City (closer to NAIA).
Take the one that's bound
           <p>for Olongapo. The trip will last around four hours. If you're going to San Antonio, you can take a 40-minute bus ride from Olongapo when you alight.</i></p>
